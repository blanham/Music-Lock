For Snell-Hitchcock Scav: The Dark Side of the Quad, in the University of Chicago 2011 Scavenger Hunt.  Item number 252.

The project was written in Processing and used a MIDI keyboard attached by USB to the computer.

In keeping with the idea of a "musical lock," we referenced Battlestar Galactica, in which All Along the Watchtower makes the Final Five Cylons realize that they are Cylons and not humans.  (See http://en.battlestarwiki.org/wiki/The_Music .)
When the key musical phrase of All Along the Watchtower is played (see http://www.bearmccreary.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/theme-final-five-g.jpg), the app displays Saul Tigh going "Oh shit, you're a Cylon."  When you get it wrong, Gaius Baltar freaks out thinking he's a Cylon, but he's really not.  He's just crazy.
